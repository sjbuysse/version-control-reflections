What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it adds a folder .git and a log and such 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory and repository are decoupled by the staging area.
The staging area is like a loading dock, that holds the elements of the working directory that will be saved to the repo.
It is usefull because sometimes you want to split up big changes into smaller changes. 
Or if you're working on something but then need to fix a small bug, you can commit JUST that bugfix 
instead of having to make a different branch.
